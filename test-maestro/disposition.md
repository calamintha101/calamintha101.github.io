# Jazz Maestro - Which Jazz Tune Should I Learn Next?


October 2021 - January 2022

Project Description
-------------------

Learning to play jazz can be overwhelming for a beginner. Jazz musicians rely on Lead Sheets, which only describe the basic melody and the chord structure of a tune. It is then up to the skills of the musicians to create the appropriate accompaniment, bass line and melody improvisation.
